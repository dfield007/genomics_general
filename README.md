#### This is a collection of scripts for genomic scale analyses and other miscellaneous tasks such as SNP marker design. Below are notes on the various scripts and how to run them.

### Sliding window genome scan (SlidingWindows.py)

A script for sliding window genome scan for diversity (pi_w, pi_T) and divergence (Fst, Dxy, Da) statistics for pooled whole genome data. Some examples below, for more details see *SlidingWindows_readme.txt*

### SNP marker design (SNPextract.py)

A script for searching for suitable biallelic SNP loci in genome wide data and extracting the sequence information required for SNP marker design. Some examples below, for more details see *SNPextract_readme.txt*
